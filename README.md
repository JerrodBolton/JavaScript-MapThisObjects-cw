### Even More Objects
Create a new empty array called ```pet_list```. Add 3 ```pet``` objects to the ```pet_list``` array (each ```pet``` should have a ```type``` and a ```breed property```) You can choose the pets.

* Add a new property called ```age``` to each pet instance in ```pet_list'''

* Assign a number for the ```age``` for all of the pets

* Iterate the list of pets and print the properties for each pet
